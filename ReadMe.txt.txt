Beau’s Contribution,  

I took on the role of main coder in the group and pioneered the implementation of mechanics. I worked closely with everyone in the group on what should be added and where. With anything I had struggled with, I asked Ella for help to troubleshoot and fix it. When coding the progression of my game, I originally planned to add new assets such as Marco (the character standing in the street) later in the game, so he wasn't standing there from the start, but I wasn't able to get it working in the game. Something I feel like I could've improved in my code is being able to simplify it more so there isn't so much repeating code but wasn't sure how to simplify it any further. Originally, I had problems as all of the items were intractable at the same time, which caused problems with the flow of the story and dialogue not matching up. 

I fixed this by adding the checkProgress function which gets checked every frame to see if the character has picked up the next item or walked through a door. Using this I was able to change values in the tileRules map to lock and unlock doors, as well as make items intractable so that dialogue will always show up in the correct order. There was also a small visual issue that causes the walking animation to glitch slightly when moving, however I don't know what is causing this and I was unable to fix it. 

 

Chay’s Contribution,  

I began by chairing the first and only meeting where I suggested the topic of Dementia and how we could bring awareness to that. I was inspired by the lesson beforehand which urged us to tackle a more social/economic cause. I took on the role of main researcher and story, after discussions and planning from other members of the group. I took all the drafts of ideas and pieced everything together to make up the story of the game. I also wrote out most of the read me file. 

I researched carefully into the topic of dementia and worked closely with Ella when it came to art so the characters, objects and dialogue would all convey the same story and meaning. Additionally, I produced scale plans and placeholder art to assist in moving the project forward. I even attempted some art which unfortunately did not make it into the game as the background layer was not transparent.  

I also worked closely with Beau to understand how dialogue could be incorporated into the code, when it would appear as well as the objective system. I also did the final presentation at the end as well as every object progression and interaction dialogue. Which was all sent to the group where Beau and Ella where able to input everything. I wanted to attempt some code as pushed to by Hugh and really tried to help implement the dialogue feature, I worked through other projects and managed to get it working on a separate p5.js test project where when you walk over the object, the dialogue appears and could be cycled through. However, when trying to implement it into the the game sketch itself, I struggled and instead sent all my code to beau in hopes that she could find a way. And she did!  

 

Ella’s Contribution: 

For this project I took on the role of lead artist, primarily handling sprite creation, character and level design. 

I also helped in developing the plot for the game. Initially, Chay proposed the idea of representing dementia throughout our 

game, but for a while we were stumped on ideas for a storyline. I had recently been watching a show called Jane the Virgin, which inspired me to come up with the plot around an elderly woman who was looking for her daughter who, in reality, had passed away a long time ago. I felt inspired by Latin American cultures and the importance of family in hispanic households, which led to the strong relationship between Alba and Laura. 

 

I had full responsibility of the artwork throughout the project - I did most of my work using Aseprite and Procreate. My biggest stylistic inspiration was the art style of Stardew Valley, particularly drawing from the style of shading and highlighting and the use of vibrant colours to create a nostalgic feeling in the game. I found it challenging working with such a small resolution, but this creative decision was ultimately necessary to achieve that retro pixel style throughout. At times, it was difficult to achieve the right look for some sprites, which meant redesigning assets over and over. It similarly was difficult working between software, particularly with Procreate which caused many transparency issues with my exports.  

 

I also handled UI and sound design, pulling the dialogue system design from games such as Stardew Valley and OMORI, and I also chose the background music for the game. 

 

Mila’s Contribution: 

I organised the first group meetings. In these crucial meetings I took notes on what possible games we could make with the grid system and organised the thoughts of the group. The most difficult part of planning the meetings was trying to find a good time for everyone to meet. This took a lot of organising around everyone’s schedule and communication between my team members. Once the group started working my role turned into creating smaller elements of the game such as the initial dialogue. This was later expanded to add more emotion and as the game came closer to finalisation.  I also created dialogue options for assets and some of the objectives. While making the objectives we had some difficulty figuring out objectives for the supermarket. Originally, we had Alma talk to one person a walk in the supermarket. We   I tried helping our artist, Ella, by creating some assets. However, they were deemed unworthy due to unclear graphics, and they just generally threw off the aesthetic of the game.  However, I did contribute a rough sketch of one of the in-game locations, the graveyard. 

I also play-tested the game for my group members and reported back any bugs back to the group.  

 

THEMES:  

Our main theme and what drives the story is Dementia. We wanted to bring awareness to the challenges and difficulties within the life of people with dementia, while at the same time not oversimplifying the neurodivergancy as something bad; it is unfortunate, but people can still maintain a good quality of life if cared and loved properly. Another powerful theme we wanted to bring to light is family. This was done through imploring strong hispanic family morals as shown through Alba’s consistent thinking of Laura and her motivation to make sure that she is all right. She searches and reminisces about their life together.  

 

DESIGN:  

When it comes to mechanics, we initially wanted to incorporate an inventory where once reminisced Items would slowly fade out of the inventory to display dementia. We however found that this wouldn’t allow the story to slowly mimic the life of someone with dementia and instead decided to focus on story. When it came to art we chose to work with pixel art as it embodies a retro rpg style such as Stardew Valley and others. Most mechanics and art was chosen in a way that would help drive the story along and make it easier for the player to digest.   

 

AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS: 

We ensured parity throughout the development of the game. As each of us discussed what we would do for each mechanic or level of the game, we also discussed what other aspect could accompany that in an equal setting. This made us automatically work closely between Art, Code and Story equally. We also decided to do a story heavy game as it allows each of us to work within our specialties without much disagreement over work itself. We did, when possible, all branch out to different areas where possible and contribute there as well.   

 

UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT: We wanted to have more interaction if possible.
