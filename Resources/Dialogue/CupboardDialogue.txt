An antique wooden cupboard positioned neatly in the corner of the room as if actively trying to hide. An intricate pattern on the handle grabs your attention and looks almost too familiar.
Laura loved this cupboard as a child; her favourite spot in hide and seek. She would pull all your clothes down and bury herself beneath them. You would open the doors and could only just make out two white and brown beads staring back at you. The girl never tidied up after herself.
