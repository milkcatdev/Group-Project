Dementia is a syndrome, characterised by a decline in cognitive function, particularly in memory, thinking, and reasoning.
Dementia is estimated to effect 7.1 % of the UK’s older population.
29–76% of people with dementia in primary care are estimated to be undiagnosed.
Risk factors for dementia include ageing, mild cognitive impairment, genetics, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease. 
Family and/or Carers are vital in supporting the patient’s “Activities of Daily Living” as well as maintaining the quality of life.
