A small note sits just under a wooden fruit bowl, it’s a sticky note that seems to have run out of the will to hold on.
How long ago was this stuck on? In beautiful handwriting, it reads:
'Hola máma, I am just going out to the shops, message me if you want me to pick up anything, love you.’ 
A small heart is drawn in the corner. It’s quite late and she's not back? 
You should probably get ready to go out and find her.'
