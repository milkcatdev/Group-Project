An ornate wall clock ticks with quiet determination, its brass hands swaying in steady rhythm. 
Yet something feels wrong. The face reads half-past four—but you were sure it was earlier than that.

You blink, but the hands stay where they are. Still, something about it feels off. 
Laura once said clocks lie when they’re too quiet. Maybe she was right.
