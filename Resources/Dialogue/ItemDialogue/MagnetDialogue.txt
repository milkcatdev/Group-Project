You lean over to open the fridge when you notice a bright lion shaped magnet clinging to the fridge;
Its mane chipped, its roar forever frozen in plastic cheer.
You stare at it, and something flickers. A zoo… maybe? Hot sun, ice cream melting down your hand. 
A child laughing, was it at the monkeys? Or the penguins? 
She held your hand the whole time. Or… maybe you held hers.
It’s hazy, like looking through fogged glass. 
But the warmth in your chest is real. That seemed like just yesterday.
