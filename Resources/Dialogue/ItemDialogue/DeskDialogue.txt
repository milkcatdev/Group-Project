A meticulously cleaned and adorned mirror set sits on the table. Wooden framed and perfectly positioned.
The mirror clearly used to be part of a twin set. The other face seems to have been screwed off to be used elsewhere.
You have a faint recollection of a young girl sitting down and giggling as you brushed the knots out of her hair. 
She seemed to admire the way you looked at her through the glass. How long ago that seemed.
