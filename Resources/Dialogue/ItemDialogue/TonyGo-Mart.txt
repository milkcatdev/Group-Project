"Oh! Hola Alma!" 
"Hm, hola mi mijo."
"How are you doing today?" 
"Good but I can't seem to find Laura anywhere." 
"Oh...She's at the church next door." 
Alma let out a sigh of releif. Laura attends a church group on Sundays. She must be with them. But was itn't today a Wendnesday? No, it couldn't be. 
"Gracias mijo."
