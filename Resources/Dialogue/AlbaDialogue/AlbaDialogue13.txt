Hi there, I was just wondering, have you seen a young woman?
I think she was supposed to be here. Or maybe I came to meet her.
She just started a new job, I think. Early twenties, tall, always in a bit of a rush. One of those long raincoats?
I’m sure she said something about needing to pick something up, but now I’m not so sure.
…
I keep thinking I’ll see her around the corner. But I haven’t yet.
