Hi.. excuse me, sorry, I know this might sound odd. Have you seen my daughter?
She left a note this morning saying she was coming to the supermarket but she hasn’t come back and it’s getting late.
She should be about thirty nine. Dark-brown hair, maybe a green coat. Occasionally wears glasses.
She teaches in a school somewhere nearby. I just thought maybe she was still here...
